Grid Wizard
-----------

For those, who are not familiar with TypoScript or just prefer the
usability of a point and click interface, there is a comfortable Grid
Wizard that will help to create the TypoScript code.


Creating the basic grid structure
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When you want to use this wizard just go to the  **Configuration** tab
of the layout record, click on the  **icon with the pencil** to the
right of the of the  **Grid Configuration** area and wait for the
popup window to open. When this is a newly created record, the wizard
will look like this:

|img-13|

Otherwise it will show a visible representation of the structure
provided in the textarea.

Now you can click on the  **small triangles** at the right and at the
bottom to create the basic grid structure. + will increase the number
of columns and/or rows, - will decrease it. To get the example we have
been using for the `Grid TS Structure
<#This%20is%20the%20complete%20example%20code|outline>`_ , the basic
grid would be looking like this:

|img-14|


Spanning, naming and assigning cells
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now you can deal with the cells that should be  **spanning multiple
columns and/or rows** . Therefor you just have to click on the
**triangle symbols beside the cells** you want to enlarge. You can
span  **right and down only** , since this resembles the way cells are
spanned in the HTML table used within the page module. Only when you
spanned a cell over at least one column and/or row, there will be
**additional triangles pointing to the left and up** , so that you can
**remove** the spanning by clicking on them.

To create the structure of the Grid TS example, you should click on
the right triangle of the upper left cell first until it spans the
whole row. Then you should click on the bottom triangle of the first
cell of the second row to have it span two rows. Finally you should
click on the right triangle of the second cell of the last row until
it spans the remaining three columns of the last row. Now the result
should be looking like this:

|img-15|

|img-16| Finally you should give the cells a  **name** and a number to
be used as the value for the internal colPos within a grid element
using this layout. And you should decide about the available content
types for each cell. If you don't set the  **column number** , the
cell will be a placeholder that can not contain any element later on.
To edit the values for each cell, just click on the  **pencil within
the square** in the middle of each cell, fill in the values and save
them by clicking on the  **disk symbol** .


Saving the layout to the CE backend layout record
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now that you have named and assigned each cell, the layout should be
looking like this:

|img-17|

You can save it by clicking on the  **disk symbol at the upper left
corner** of the popup window. Depending on the names and column values
you have been using, the result should be close to the example we have
been using in the `Grid TS structure
<#This%20is%20the%20complete%20example%20code|outline>`_ section. When
you open the wizard the next time, it will come up in the same state.
