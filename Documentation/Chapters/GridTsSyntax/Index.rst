Grid TS Syntax
--------------

The syntax we use to store information about the grid structure within
the page and CE backend layout records is basically  *TypoScript* .
Both grid view and grid elements are using the internal TS parser of
the core to transform this syntax into an array, which is then used by
the different methods we attached to the hooks provided by the core.

We could have used serialized objects or arrays as well, but decided
to go for TypoScript, since this can easily be written by advanced
integrators. For those, who are not familiar with TypoScript or just
prefer the usability of a point and click interface, there is a
comfortable `Grid Wizard <#1.5.Grid%20Wizard|outline>`_ that will help
to create the TypoScript code. Later on it might be more convenient to
modify the structures by hand, especially when backend layouts that
are based on a similar structure haven't got too many differences.

Step by step:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Start with the number of columns and rows
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Go to the  **Configuration** tab of the layout record and edit the
**Grid Configuration** there. The wrapper for the whole block is the
same as for pages:  **backend\_layout** – Use the keys  **colCount**
and  **rowCount** to create the basic grid structure. Both values
should be at least the lowest common multiple of the column sizes you
want to create. They represent the actual grid behind the cell
structure. The calculation should take into account that you might be
using colspan and rowspan as well.

::

  backend_layout {
    colCount = 4
    rowCount = 3
  }


Fill in the rows
""""""""""""""""

The array of rows does not offer any specialties. It is just a simple
array with numeric keys. You will need a key for each possible row,
even though it might stay empty later on.


::

  backend_layout {
    colCount = 4
    rowCount = 3
    rows {
      1 {
      ...
      }
      2 {
      ...
      }
      3 {
      ...
      }
    }
  }


Create the cells
""""""""""""""""

Each of the cells comes with up to 5 different keys:  **name** ,
**colPos** ,  **colspan** ,  **rowspan** and  **allowed** . There must
be at least the  **name** and if you want to use the column as
something else than a placeholder, there must be a value for
**colPos** as well. Otherwise the cell will be marked as  *inactive*
in the page module.

The values for  **colspan** ,  **rowspan** and  **allowed** are
optional. The  **allowed** feature is used to determine those content
element types the user will be allowed to use within this column. You
can use a comma separated list of Ctype values here and as soon as
this contains at least one value, any other element type will be
forbidden. The  **colPos** value will be used while fetching the
content elements from the database, since grid view and grid elements
are using normalized relations to relate columns and content elements
with each other.

The following example will create a cell for a larger top column with
only  *text* and  *text with image* allowed as a content type:



::

  backend_layout {
    colCount = 4
    rowCount = 3
    rows {
    1 {
      columns {
        1 {
          name = Top
          colspan = 4
          colPos = 0
          allowed = text,textpic
        }
      }
    }
    2 {
      columns {
        1 {
          name = Outer Left
          rowspan = 2
          colPos = 1
        }
        2 {
          name = Left
          colPos = 2
        }
        3 {
          name = Right
          colPos = 3
        }
        4 {
          name = Outer Right
          colPos = 4
        }
      }
    }
    3 {
      columns {
        1 {
          name = Bottom
          colspan = 4
          colPos = 5
        }
      }
    }
  }


This is the visible result of the example code

When you now edit this grid element, you can see how the child
elements are connected to their parent grid via the core functions
provided by Inline Relational Record Editing (IRRE). You will even be
able to edit any element within a possible tree of nested grids and
their children without having to deal with the whole page module, but
of course you will lose the structured view of the grid this way.
Sorting by D&D or clicking on the sorting arrows will be disabled
inside the editing form as well. But you still can sort elements by
directly dragging and dropping them in the page module.
