Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Download or import the Grid Elements extension
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

First you should download the extension either as a T3X file, that you
can import with the Extension Manager, or directly from the TER by
using the repository import features of the Extension Manager.


Install the Grid Elements extension
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After download and/or import have been completed, you have to install
Grid Elements with the Extension Manager to make use of it. There are
no dependencies, so you should be able to do so without problems. The
only extension, that will have conflicts, is TemplaVoila, since it
uses some of the hooks used by Grid Elements as well. You can still
install Grid Elements by ignoring the warning of the Extension Manager
though, so advanced users might have both extension active while
migrating from one to the other. But TemplaVoila features will be
disabled then.

When the Extension Manager is asking you for permission to add and/or
modify some of the database tables, you should give your OK, so the
necessary fields will be available.

**Important Note** : The colPos field of the tt\_content table will be
changed from unsigned int(3) to smallint(6) to enable the usage of
negative values. This should  **never be reverted** by any upgrade
script later on! Otherwise any child element will be moved from it's
parent container to the default page column. Some people ran into
problems during automatic upgrades done by their providers. So be sure
to make a backup of your content before upgrading!


Include static template(s)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In most of the cases you want a working frontend output as well. So
you should go to the Template module, edit your main TypoScript
template record and include the static template there. This will be
providing the basic TypoScript setup for the Grid Elements frontend
plugin. You will find it in the select box at the  *Include static
(from extensions)* section of the  *Includes* tab. Currently there is
only one static template  *gridelements(gridelements)* available.
There might be more in future releases.

Create some CE backend layouts
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To make use of any backend layout within content elements you have to
create some  *CE backend layout* records first. The process is similar
to the one you might already know from the page backend layouts
provided by the TYPO3 core. Switch to the list module and select the
page, that you want to use as the container for your backend layouts

- If you are using a so called  *General Record Storage Page* , i.e. for
  *tt\_news* , you must place your backend layouts there as well. And
  since you can define a storage page for your backend layout records by
  *TSconfig* , you should select the page you have defined there, if
  any.

- Click on the  *Create new record* button and select  *CE backend
  layout* in the  *Grid Elements* section.

- Give your element a title and description, upload an icon to be used
  in the layout selector box later on and select one of the available
  colors if you want to use a colored frame for your grid.

- If you want the children of the Grid container to appear side by side
  (i.e. to create a tab container or a twitter bootstrap row), you can
  activate the checkbox.

- Now you can either manually enter the `TypoScript
  <#1.6.TypoScript|outline>`_ setup for your layout, or have it created
  with the `Grid Wizard <#1.5.Grid%20Wizard|outline>`_ . Go to the
  appropriate chapters to find out how to do so.

  |img-7|

- If necessary you can fill in a flexform datastructure to provide
  additional settings within your grid element. Values of these
  flexforms will be available within the data set of the Grid Element
  during frontend output later on. Go to the `flexform
  <#1.7.Flexform|outline>`_ chapter to find out how to do that.

Now save the record and create some more layouts if you like.


Create new Grid Elements
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now that you have some  *CE backend layouts* available, you can easily
use them to create new grid elements. There is a feature called  *New
Content Element Wizard Overlay* . So go to the page module now and
activate it by clicking on the  *Create new record* button on top of
the module. Now you can drag any kind of content element from this
wizard into any of the visible and active columns of the current page.
Select one of the available Grid Elements and while you drag it, some
highlighted drop zones will appear to let you drop it into the desired
column. After a few seconds the spinner symbol will disappear and show
your newly created grid element. Drag in as many elements as necessary
for the desired page layout.

|img-8|

**Note:** Of course you can drag elements into the columns of a Grid
Element as well, as soon as you got at least one of them on your page.
So nesting can be done with the drag in wizard within just a few
seconds as well.


Change existing elements into Grid Elements
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to change existing elements into Grid Elements you can do
so in the content editing form. Just edit the desired content element
and change the type to  *Grid Element* . The editing form will change
and show you the appropriate fields. Go to the  *Grid Layout* section
of the  *General* tab and select one of the backend layouts you have
created before. Now save the record and close, and you should see the
new Grid Element in your page module.

|img-9|


Fill your grid with content elements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now that you have created all the necessary grids you can fill them
with content elements. You can either use the same drag in wizard as
you have been using while creating the grids, or you can use the “
*Create new record on top of this column* ” button to add new content
elements without dragging. Of course you can copy and/or move existing
elements into the columns of your newly created grids and even
creating references to elements in the clipboard is possible.

|img-10|


Include your own TypoScript
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default template of the plugin will just provide the most basic
functionality. It will create the content of any column within a grid
container as a serialized chain of child elements. So each of the
children will be put into a div container, that will again be put into
a div container of the column it has been taken from, that will
finally be put into a div container of the parent Grid Element. If you
want to provide more sophisticated stuff, go to the `TypoScript
<#1.6.TypoScript|outline>`_ section of this manual and see what is
possible.
